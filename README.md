# jspsych-react-cra
* Bootstrapped using [npx create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
* Source code forked from [jspsych-react](https://github.com/openexp/jspsych-react)

## Getting started
* Install with `npm install`
* Build react and importable/bundled files with `npm run build`, as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60604886/bundle-react-app-created-with-npx-create-react-app-to-js-file-using-webpack)

## Notes
* The package is pointing to a [forked, "modular" version of jspsych (v6.1 ??)](https://github.com/makebrainwaves/jspsych/tree/modular) that has some minor modifications implemented by the _makebrainwaves_ developers. It may be possible to update this to a [modular version of jsPsych currently in development](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/tree/modularization-extensions).
* If it's desired to make repo private, must provide private key in the `package.json` (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28728665/how-to-use-private-github-repo-as-npm-dependency))
