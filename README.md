# jspsych-react-cra
Forked from [jspsych-react]() 

## Notes
* The package is pointing to a [forked, "modular" version of jspsych (v6.1 ??)](https://github.com/makebrainwaves/jspsych/tree/modular) that has some minor modifications implemented by the _makebrainwaves_ developers. It may be possible to update this to a [modular version of jsPsych currently in development](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/tree/modularization-extensions).
* If it's desired to make repo private, must provide private key in the `package.json` (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28728665/how-to-use-private-github-repo-as-npm-dependency))
